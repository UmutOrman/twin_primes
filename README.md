# twin_primes
Finding twin primes till specified number n with MPI processes(parallel computing)
Twin primes are prime numbers which differ by 2 (e.g. (3,5), (5,7) etc.)
As an example, when your program is given n = 19 as input, it should return the following pointer array
pointer → {3, 5}
pointer → {5, 7}
pointer → {11, 13}
pointer → {17, 19}
